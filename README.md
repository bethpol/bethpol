### Hi everybody! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Beth, thanks for checking out my github.

I'm a senior in high school and passionate about CS. I'm excited to attend Cornell College of Engineering next year and major in computer science! In the mean time, here are some of my main CS interests.

* Web development - learning node.js, although you probably won't see a lot of that on here!
* Cybersecurity - took an intro course through Project Lead the Way during my junior year of high school. Very interested in learning more :)
* I'm also interested in learning about human computer interaction!
